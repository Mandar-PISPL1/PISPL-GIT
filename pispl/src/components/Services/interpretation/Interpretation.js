              <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>Simultaneous interpretation (SI) is a mode of interpretation where the interpreter translates the information from one language to another in real-time.
                <br /><br />
                This seamless interpretation translates the words and thoughts in the target language simultaneously while the speaker is speaking. This helps in maintaining a smooth flow, without any pause or interruption. One of the biggest advantages of simultaneous interpretation is it saves time, maintains accuracy and delivers in real-time.
                <br /><br />
                The simultaneous interpreters and translators need to be well versed with both the source and target languages in order to convey the right information. The interpreters need to listen, analyse and convey the source language in the target language simultaneously.
                Our video remote interpretation services provide experienced professional interpreters with exceptional skills, cultural awareness and language fluency. The simultaneous interpreters are also called conference interpreters as this type of interpretation is mainly used in large-scale events, meetings and conferences.
                <br /><br />

                This real-time translation or interpretation is also used in safety or emergency situations and global conferences where the information is to be conveyed globally in multiple languages.

              <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>Consecutive Interpretation (CI) is a mode of interpretation where the interpreter translates the information from one language to another after a pause or certain period of time. Firstly the professional interpreter gathers the information accurately and then passes it on to the targeted audience.
                <br /><br />
                The interpreter might take notes when the speaker is conveying the message and then reproduce the information to the audience. The consecutive interpretation can also happen when the speaker pauses after one or two sentences while the interpreter delivers it to the audience in the target language.
                <br /><br />
                The consecutive interpreters must be active listeners, who accurately pay attention to your speeches and take notes. Our video remote interpretation services provide experienced interpreters and translators with exceptional skills, cultural awareness and language fluency.
                <br /><br />
                Their sharp memory and attentiveness help them communicate better with the audience. This type of interpretation is widely used in business meetings, interviews, medical consultations, legal meetings, schools and places where time isnâ€™t a constraint. One of the biggest advantages of consecutive interpretation is its reliability, effectiveness and ability to connect better with the audience.
